This document describes how to setup distributed version

0. design the distributed assocation system
   1 node should be a parent node, and the others should be children.
   For SMP architechture machine, it is a good idea to assign more than
   one role for a machine.
   Useally a client(parent) and a server(child) communicate via TCP.
   Assign a name and port number for this commuincation. e.x. add following
   to /etc/services:
getassoc 12345/tcp

   In case that a client and a server resides same machine, LOCAL socket
   provides higher perfomance.  Decide pipe name: e.x. /tmp/getassoc.sock

   Finally, write all servers in `@prefix@/etc/dnwam.conf'
   Each line consists HOST\tPORT\tLOCALSOCKET.
   One of HOST\tPORT or LOCALSOCKET may be empty,
   or getassoc tries to connect LOCALSOCKET first, then HOST\tPORT.
   example follows:
localhost\tgetassoc\t/tmp/getassoc.sock
example.com\tgetassoc\t
\t\t/tmp/getassoc.sock
   In this example, there are tow servers (localhost and example.com).
   Each server will assigned node-id in order, start from 0, so
   localhost will be the 0th server and example.com will be the 1st server.
   If more than the servers described in dnwam.conf are required,
   this list is used cyclically. for example, if the 2nd server is requestd,
   localhost will be designated.

1. Prepare index directory. 
   Distributed index for each node must be created under @prefix@/pwam.
   Each directory should be named ${DIR}.${NODEID},
   here ${DIR} is 0 and 1, and ${NODEID} is the order of the server
   in dnwam.conf, (start from 0).
   If @prefix@/pwam is shared, or you do not care for unsed directory,
   the following is suffice: (for 8 x 8 distributed-indice)

	for d in 0 1; do
		for h in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7; do
			mkdir @prefix@/pwam/$d.$h
		done
	done

2. start xgetassoc-server on each host: In our case, 
   ./xgetassoc 12 -p getassoc -u /tmp/getassoc.sock &
and
   ./xgetassoc 12 -p getassoc &
for localhost and example.com respectively.


3. creating distributed index
   to create #-distributed indice, followig dnwam.conf plan,
   pass -o,-D,#,-C,dnwam.conf to stp.  to make 2 x 2 indice,
   ./stp -o,-D,2,-C,dnwam.conf -b $GETAROOT $handle title,link < $handle.itb


   additional info: If the number of articles server and words server is not equal,
	use -D to specify the number of indice for word to article association
	and use -Y to specify the number of indice for article to word association.
	If the articles servers set and words servers set is not same,

	use -C to specify the configuration file for article association servers,
	and use -X to specify the configuration file for word association servers.
