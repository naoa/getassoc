If getassoc is configured with --enable-newlayout=yes,
shareable binaries and data files are installed in common area,
where specified with --prefix.

$prefix/bin -- commands that user uses in first hand
	simcomp		similarity compiler
	stp		WAM setup wrapper to xgetassoc
	tgetassoc	standalone self-testing tools
	wtouch		toches WAM to make be cached

$prefix/include/getassoc -- include files
	nwam.h
	simdef.h

$prefix/lib -- libraries
	libnwam.{a,so,dylib}
	*.{so,bundle}	compiled similarity

$prefix/libexec/getassoc -- programs that are called from another program
	getassoc	cgi-bin entry program
	otmi2itb	called from stp, to convert OTMI-format into ITB-format
	tsv2itb		called from stp, to convert TSV-format into ITB-format
	xgetassoc	called from stp, to make WAM

$prefix/share/
	share/getassoc/*

On the other hand, user provided data may placed anywhere user likes.
Assume the directory be $getaroot.
The catalogue file, temporary file, WAM, distributed-WAM are created
into $getaroot/etc, $getaroot/tmp, $getaroot/nwam, $getaroot/pwam respectively.

Futhermore, a wrapper of cgi-bin entry program is also placed here,
typically, $getaroot/bin/getassoc.
The warpper program is a short shell script that just call the
cgi-bin entry program, with an argument.
The argument tells cgi-bin entry program where the $getaroot is
(see sample below).

Any file which does not conflict with above may put here,
such as dnwam.conf and rcfile.

$getaroot/bin
	getassoc	wrapper for cgi-bin entry program

$getaroot/etc
	catalogue.xml	catalogue of intalled WAM
	dnwam.conf	distributed-WAM configuration file
	rcfile		a file that supplies defalut values to gss3.

$getaroot/tmp -- working directory

$getaroot/nwam -- installed WAM

$getaroot/pwam -- installed distributed-WAM
	m.n		WAM which contains m'th portion of document subset and n'th portion of word subset.


$getaroot/bin/getassoc -- a wrapper
#! /bin/sh
exec $prefix/libexec/getassoc/getassoc -R $getaroot
