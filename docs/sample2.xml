			<otmi:snippet>Welcome to the   millennial year  at the threshold of   millennium three .    During   millennium two ,  humanity continually redefined its concept of "Universe":  first as spheres centered on the   Earth , in mid-millennium as the   Solar System , a few centuries ago as the   Galaxy , and within the last century as the   matter  emanating from the   Big Bang .    During   millennium three  humanity may hope to discover   alien life , to understand the   geometry and composition of our present concept of Universe ,  and even to   travel through this Universe .    Whatever our   accomplishments , humanity will surely find   adventure  and   discovery  in the   space above and beyond , and possibly define the   surrounding Universe   in ways and colors we cannot yet imagine by the threshold of   millennium four .</otmi:snippet>

	<atom:title>The Largest Rock Known</atom:title>

			<otmi:snippet>There, that faint dot in the center -  that's the largest rock known.    It is larger than every known  asteroid ,  moon , and   comet nucleus .   It is larger than any   other rocky planet .   (Nobody knows for sure what size rocks  lie at the cores of  Jovian planets , or orbit other stars.)   The  Voyager  1 spacecraft took  this picture  in 1990 from the outer   Solar System .    This rock is so large its  gravity  makes it nearly spherical,  and holds heavy gases near its surface.   Yesterday, this rock started another orbit around its   parent star ,  for roughly the 5 billionth time,  spinning over 350 times during each trip.    Happy  Gregorian Calendar   New Year to all the human inhabitants of   this rock  we call   Earth .</otmi:snippet>

	<atom:title>Cas A Supernova Remnant in X-Rays</atom:title>

			<otmi:snippet>The complex shell of a star seen to explode  300 years ago is helping astronomers to  understand how that star exploded.    The  above recently released image  of supernova remnant   Cassiopeia A  (Cas A) shows unprecedented detail in three   X-ray  colors.    The relationship between brightness, color,  and position of material in the image indicates  where in the star this material was just before  the explosion.    Bright knots on the left, for example, contain little iron,  and so are   hypothesized  to originated from a higher layer  than outer red filaments, which are  iron  rich.    The blue region on the right is seen through absorbing   dust ,   and so appears depleted of low-energy X-rays.   It takes light ten years to cross the gas shell of the   Cas A supernova remnant , which is 10,000   light-years  distant.  Most of the   elements   that make people and planets were produced in   supernova explosions .</otmi:snippet>

	<atom:title>Galaxies Cluster Toward the Great Attractor</atom:title>

			<otmi:snippet>Galaxies dot the sky like   jewels  in the direction  of a mass so large it is known simply as the   Great Attractor .   The galaxies   pictured above  are part of a   cluster of galaxies   called   ACO 3627  near the center of the  Great Attractor .    Previously, this   cluster of galaxies , also known as the Norma Cluster, was largely  unstudied because dust in the disk of   our own Galaxy obscured  much of its light.    The  Great Attractor  is a diffuse mass concentration  fully 250 million light-years away,  but so large it pulls our own   Milky Way Galaxy  and  millions of others galaxies towards it.    Many of the galaxies in   ACO 3627   are slowly heading towards   collisions  with each other.</otmi:snippet>
